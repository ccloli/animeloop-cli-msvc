# animeloop-cli
![Animeloop Logo](https://animeloop.org/files/animeloop.gif)

Animeloop command line tool. The goal of this project is to automatically find and cut out the looping fragments in Japanese anime. For details, please see my [technical report(English)](https://animeloop.org/files/paper/technical_report_en.pdf), [technical report(Chinese)](https://animeloop.org/files/paper/technical_report_zh.pdf).

_This is an unoffical MSVC port._

## Note for MSVC version

### Why?

As I need `animeloop-cli` to run on Windows, so I tried to build it by myself.

Unfortunately, when I built it with MinGW under MSYS2, GCC couldn't compile `child_process.cpp`, as it uses `fork()` that only works on POSIX (or say *nix).

Then I tried to build it with MSYS under MSYS2, which is an Cygwin port -- which simulates POSIX functions -- after resolving linking problems, it compiles successfully, but when it runs, it shows runtime error `while loading shared libraries: ?`, and I don't know what is `?`.

Then I tried Cygwin, after grabbing all the dependencies with the messy installer (sorry but I think package manager like `apt` or `pacman` is better) and start to compile, it shows some compile target errors, and I'm not sure what's up.

So I gave it up, and made a Microsoft Visual C++ port.

### What's changed?

- Instead of using POSIX `fork()`, it uses Windows `CreateProcess()` to create child process, so it's not available to build on *nix.

- Use Windows CLI `where` to detect FFmpeg.

- Show FFmpeg convert status when resizing video.

### How to build?

Checkout _Installation_ section, the Windows steps are appended after Arch Linux (and you won't like it).

Or you can download the binary built by myself from [GitHub release page](https://github.com/ccloli/animeloop-cli-msvc/releases).

## Installation

### Install via Arch Linux User Repository (aur)

> This is the original release, not the MSVC one.

#### with [yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt)
``` Shell
yaourt -S animeloop-cli
```

### Download prebuilt binary for Windows

Checkout [GitHub release page](https://github.com/ccloli/animeloop-cli-msvc/releases), and download FFmpeg 3.x binary from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/ or build FFmpeg by yourself. 

### Install manually

#### Modules Init

``` Shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```


#### Dependencies

##### macOS

> Not supported for this fork (except Visual Studio for macOS does some trick to support Windows API?)

##### Debian/Ubuntu

> Not supported for this fork, but you can cross compile it with MinGW.

##### Arch Linux

> Not supported for this fork, but you can cross compile it with MinGW.

##### Windows MinGW

```shell
# - Assume you're building to mingw64, if you'd like to build to mingw32, replace `mingw-w64-x86_64` with `mingw-w64-i686`
#
# - Some packages are updated and not compatible, so some of the steps are using `pacman -U` to install specific version 
#   packages with USTC Mirrors, you can change `https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64/` to other sources.

# Build deps
pacman -S libintl mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake

# Boost
# - It seems that when using Boost 1.66+ will cause build fail
pacman -U https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-boost-1.64.0-3-any.pkg.tar.xz

# OpenCV
pacman -U https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-opencv-3.4.3-2-any.pkg.tar.xz
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hdf5

# Jsoncpp
# - JSONCPP comes with cmake, so if you've install cmake manually, you're not needed to install JSONCPP again
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-jsoncpp

# FFmpeg
# - Some dll files are missing in MSYS2 MinGW64 FFmpeg package, so you should download it from other builds
# - You can also download it later, as it's not build dependency (but runtime dependency)
# pacman -U https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64/mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg-3.4.2-1-any.pkg.tar.xz
wget https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-3.4.2-win64-static.zip
unzip -p ffmpeg-3.4.2-win64-static.zip ffmpeg-3.4.2-win64-static/bin/ffmpeg.exe > /mingw64/bin/ffmpeg.exe
```

##### Windows via Microsoft Visual Studio

- Download and install [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
    > Will uses Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise (VC14) as example for below.

- Download [CMake-GUI](https://cmake.org/download/)

- Download [Boost prebuilt library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/) for VC14
	> You may need a older version (< 1.66.0) in case of some unknown bug.

- Download [OpenCV prebuilt library](https://opencv.org/releases/) for Windows
	> OpenCV should be 3.2+ but not 4.x

- Download [HDF5 prebuilt library](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5) for VC14
	> You may need an account to download the file, you can register for free or build your own.
	> If you don't want to install the msi package, run `msiexec /a drive:\path\to\file.msi /qb TARGETDIR=drive:\path\to\extract`

- Download [JSONCPP prebuilt library](http://access.osvr.com/binary/deps/jsoncpp) for VC14

#### Compile & Build 

##### Xcode

> Not supported for this fork

##### CMake

``` Shell
cd animeloop-cli
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make animeloop-cli
```

##### CMake-GUI and Visual Studio

- CMake-GUI
	* Create folder `build` under `animeloop-cli` folder as `Target` folder
	* Set `Source` and `Target` folder
	* Click `Configure` button, select Visual Studio 2015
	* Resolve missing parameters
	* Click `Genereate` button
	* If everything is okay, open the `sln` file under `build` folder

- Visual Studio
	* Select `animeloop-cli` project, and start building
	* If link directories or include directories specificed in CMake is not included, you should config them manually. Here are my configuration, you can change it to your exact folder:
		```
		Include directories: Y:\opencv\build\include;Y:\hdf5\HDF_Group\HDF5\1.10.5\include;Y:\jsoncpp\include;Y:\boost_1_64_0;$(IncludePath)
		Library directories: Y:\opencv\build\x64\vc14\lib;Y:\hdf5\HDF_Group\HDF5\1.10.5\lib;Y:\jsoncpp\lib;Y:\boost_1_64_0\lib64-msvc-14.0;$(LibraryPath)
		```
	* If you got `C2001` error or it shows encoding problem, convert all files to UTF-8 with BOM, or set project encoding to Unicode (but may still meet encoding problem when running on some code page like CP936).
